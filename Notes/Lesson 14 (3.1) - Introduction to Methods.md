# Lesson 14

## Goal
- Design better than existing design
- New way to old task
- Novelty should have the purpose, and understand the users task

In this unit we will cover the following topics:

1. User-centered design
2. Four stages of the design life cycle
3. Qualitative vs quantitative data
4. Design life cycle

## User-centered Design

- **User-centerde design** - design that considers the needs of the user throughout the entire design process
	- prioritizing user need and we dont know user need
	- Often design is done based on technical task rather than user.
	- In general we can't design great interfaces just by applying guidelines and heuristics. Instead, we have to interact with our users, understand their needs, and involve them in the evaluation process.


## Principles Of User-centered Design

There are six principles of user-centered design: (ISO)

1. The design is based upon an explicit understanding of users, tasks, and environments - Do needfinding
2. Users are involved throughout design and development - Interviews, Surveys etc.
3. The design is driven and refined by user-centered evaluation. Real users evaluate the prototype.
4. The process is iterative - No single shot results.
5. The design addresses the whole user experience - Entire experience is to be considered.
6. The design team includes multidisciplinary skills and perspectives - CS scientists, psych, designer and more

## Stakeholders

There are many types of stakeholders who user or are impacted by our interface:

- **Primary** - our user who uses the interface directly. Grade book tool - Teachers
- **Secondary** - are people who don't use our system directly but who might interact with the output of it in some way. - Grade book tool Parents. Helicopter Parenting
- **Tertiary** - are people who never interact with the tool or output but who are nonetheless impacted by the existence of the tool. Grade book tool - Students
- Inmates are running the asylum - book by alan cooper

## The Design Life Cycle

User-centered design is about integrating the user into every phase of the design life cycle. We need to know two things:

1. What the design life cycle is
2. How to integrate the user into each phase

Our model of a design life cycle will cover four phases:

1. **Need-finding** - we gather a comprehensive understanding of the task the users are trying to perform
2. **Design alternatives** - developing very early ideas on the different ways to approach the task
3. **Prototyping** - take the ideas with the most potential and we build them into protoypes that we can then actually put in front of a user
4. **Evaluation** - we take our ideas that we prototyped and put them in front of actual users, here is where we get user feedback

## Methods For The Design Life Cycle

- Design life cycle is similar to user using interface
- Shown below is the design life cycle with methods in between each phase.


## Qualitative Vs Quantitative Data

**Quantitative data**:

- Observations described or summarized numerically
- Supports formal tests, comparisons, and conclusions
- Is strong for a small class of things
- Captures narrow view
- what is found

**Qualitative data**:

- Observations described or summarized non-numerically
- Supports any kind of response or observation
- Covers a broader picture of what we're examining
- Is more prone to biases
- Description, observations, natural language
- Convert qualitative to quantitative data.
- How and why is found

**Mixed method**: a mixture of qualitative and quantitative data from same participants 

## Types Of Nominal Data

There are four main types of quantitative data:

1. Nominal - Categorical - Number of instances of different categories 
	- Single nominal - One category 
	- Multiple nominal -  More than one category
	- Binary (yes/no) and Non binary
2. Ordinal - Similar to nominal, but there is explicit ordering. Scale of 1-5. Gap is unclear.
	- It can be multinominal
	- Binary (Fail/Pass) and Non binary
3. Interval - We do know exact difference between value. Commuting between 4-6am. 64 degree celcius is not twice as warm as 32.
4. Ratio - Ratio data. Absolute value and ratio could be established.
	- Discrete - Countable
	- Continous - Non- Countable

## Types Of Qualitative Data

- Depends on how its gathered
- There are many types of qualitative data, below are some examples:

1. Transcripts - Interview/Focus group
2. Field notes - Participant Observation
3. Artifacts - Reviews for Existing interfaces
4. Others - Many more/ Not mentioned

- Expensive to analyze, interpretaition bias, 
- Qualitative data -to- Quantitative using coding
	- We dont loose, only transformation
	- Documented methodology is obtained
	- Always mix these two
