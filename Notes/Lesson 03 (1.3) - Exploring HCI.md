# Lesson 3

There are three main application areas we are focused on (technologies, domains, and ideas):

1. **Technologies** are emerging technological capabilities that let us create new and interesting user interactions
2. **Domains** are pre-existing areas that could be significantly disrupted by computer interfaces like healthcare and education
3. **Ideas** span both technologies and domains, they are theories about the way people interact with interfaces and the world around them

## Technologies

- **Virtual reality** - an immersive computer-simulated reality
- **Augmented reality** - real-world environments that are complemented by computer generated multimedia
- **Ubiquitous computing** - computing power anytime, anywhere
- **Wearable technology** - technology embedded in clothing or devices a person can wear
- **Mobile**: portable computing devices built to be used easily on the go

## Ideas

- **Context-sensitive computing** - equipping user interfaces with historical, geographical, or other forms of contextual knowledge
- **Gesture-based interaction** - interacting with interfaces using hand or body gestures
- **Information visualization** - representing abstract data visually to help humans understand it
- **Computer-supported cooperative work** - using computers to support people working together

## Domains

HCI applies to many different domains. Domains such as special needs, education, healthcare, security, and games are massive opportunities for HCI

## Important videos

Understand all videos at once. Possible question could be which is an area which is related to HCI or not.
