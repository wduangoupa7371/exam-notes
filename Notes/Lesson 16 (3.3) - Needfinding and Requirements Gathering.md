# Lesson 16

In this lesson we will look into needfinding a.k.a requirement finding:

1. Defining questions about the user
2. Generating answers about the user
3. Formalizing models of the user

## Data Inventory

Before doing need-finding there is a list of questions which are useful to keep in mind:
- Ultimately we want to answer

1. Who are the users?
2. Where are the users?
3. What is the context of the task?
4. What are their goals?
5. What do they need?
6. What are their tasks?
7. What are their subtasks?

## The Problem Space

We also need to identify the problem space:

1. Where is the task occurring?
2. What else is going on?
3. What are the user's explicit and implicit needs?

- Understand scope of the space

## User Types

- As we consider the problem space we also should get an idea of the space of the user i.e., we want to understand who we are designing for.
- Find full range of users
	- Kid vs Adults
	- Experts vs Novices
	- Exercising Experts vs Novices


## Avoiding Bias In Need-finding

Below are five tips in avoiding bias during need-finding:

1. Confirmation bias - We see what we want to see. Test empirically, keep samples covered
2. Observer bias - subconciouslusly bias the users. Make questions in interviews
3. Social desirability bias - Dont make people happy. Make naturalistic observations.
4. Voluntary response bias - Oversampling. Reduce survey shown
5. Recall bias - People arent good what they did during activity done in past

## Naturalistic Observation

Understand the problem space and ask people later on.

Below are five tips to use during observation:

1. Take notes - Gather targeted information and observation.
2. Start specific, then abstract - Risk Tunnel vision
3. Spread out your sessions
4. Find a partner - Take notes and compare with partners
5. Look for questions - Should inform questions what you need during targeted needfinding


## Hacks And Workarounds

- No need direct interaction, just get inside their head.
	- How to accomplish a task using some shortcut.
	- Hack around using computer limitation
		- Why they using them
		- Different design challenge
			- identify errors

- **Hacks** - are ways users get around the interface to accomplish their tasks
- **Errors** - slips or mistakes that users frequently make while performing the task within the interface

## Interviews

Five quick tips for conducting effective interviews:

1. Focus on the six W's (who, what, when, where, why, and how)
	- Avoid yes and no
	- use openended and semiphrases questions
2. Be aware of bias
3. Listen
4. Organize the interview
	- Intro
	- Light questions
	- Summary
5. Practice
	- Practice in research partners

## Think Aloud
- Think louder in context of task
- Post Event Protocol
		- get information immediately after activity

## Surveys

- Get large data in quick time
	- Decide what to ask during interviews

Here are five tips for designing an effective survey:

1. Less is more - affects response rate and reliabiity
2. Be aware of bias - Look at how you are phrasing questions
3. Tie them to the inventory - Start with goals and write qeustions and connect it
4. Test it out - test using coworkers.
5. Iterate - Revise and test

## Writing Good Survey Questions

How do we write good survey questions?

1. Be clear 
	- Make sure what you are asking
	- Dont ask overlapping range
	- Give extra detail
	- Time box frequency based questions
2. Be concise
	- Ask in plain language
	- Consise vs clear is a tradeoff
3. Be specific
	- Avoid questions on super big ideas
	- Double barrel question --> avoid them
4. Be expressive
	- Emphasize users opinions
	- User ranges instead of yes/no questions
	- Give levels of frequency or agreement
	- Allow users to add nominal categories
		- FB vs Snapchat vs Others
5. Be unbiased
	- Leave open ended question open
	- Avoid loaded questions (wasted vs spent)
6. Be usable
	- Provide progress bar
	- Page length consistency
	- Order your questions logically with a flow
	- Alert users about unanswered questions
	- Preview survey yourself.
- Ask for feedback before sending

## Other approaches for data gathering
- Critique Existing UI
- See user reviews to find what users think
- Use variety of methods to get complete picture of users task


## Pros and Cons of Needfinding methods
See video 21

## Interative Needfinding
- We can use many approaches during iterative needfinding cycle.

## Revisiting Inventory
- After getting enormous amount of data, revisit inventory of things what we wanted to gather based on following questions

1. Who are the users?
2. Where are the users?
3. What is the context of the task?
4. What are their goals?
5. What do they need?
6. What are their tasks?
7. What are their subtasks?

## Representing need
- Create representation for need
	- Task outline
	- Hierarchical network graph
	- Structural relationship between components
	- Flow chart with decisions
- Similar to task analysis
	- Data gathered can summarize task analysis


## Defining The Requirements

The final step for need-finding is to define our requirements. These are the requirements that the interface must meet. They should be specific and capable of being evaluated.
	- Requirements can include components outside task
	- User related tasks
		- Functionality, Usability, Learning, Accessiblity.
		- Compatability, Compliance, Cost.

## Conclusions

Need-finding is how you develop your understanding of the needs of your user. We have discussed many different approaches from low-intervention to high-intervention:

Low-intervention need-finding:

- Naturalistic observation
- Participant observation

Mid-intervention need-finding:

- Errors and hacks
- Surveys, interviews, and focus groups

High-intervention need-finding:

- Ethnography
