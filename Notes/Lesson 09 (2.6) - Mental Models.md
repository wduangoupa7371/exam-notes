# Lesson 9

In this lesson we cover the following on mental models and representations:

1. **Mental model** - an internal, simulatable understanding of external reality. Good interface will give good mental models.
2. **Representations** - Internal symbols for an external reality. Helps users learners to use our interface quickly.
3. Metaphors and analogies - used to create good representations.
4. User error: Slips and mistakes in mental models
5. Learned Helplessness - Repurcussion of poor interface design
6. Expert Blind Spot - Reason why poor design can occur


## Mental Model
- Is a person understanding of real word working - processes relationship and connection in real systems
- Predict and check outcome of mental model. Basket ball example. Simulate the event to make prediction
- When reality does match? why is mental model wrong? dicomfort, curious? frustration and never will get it.
- Match users models and interface
	* Design systems that acts how its expected or teach people how they act.	
- Mental models are not unique to HCI. Also in Edtech. No stand and explanation
- Good representaion show how system works. But very challenging

## Model model in climate control system
- David's old and new car - Both I dint get a thing. Sadly I dont have one!!

## 5 Tips: Mental Models For Learnable Interfaces

Below are five tips to leverage for creating learnable interfaces: (Dix et al)

1. Predictability - User should be able to predict what will happen before perform it
2. Synthesizability - But you should know the process on how you reached current state. Log of commands in CLI
3. Familiarity - Leverage actions with user is familiar. Like affordance
4. Generalizability - Knowledge of one user interface should generalize to others
5. Consistency - Single action and consistent. ctrl x for cut only.


## Representations

1. Ensure effective mental model - we get to choose how things are shown to users.
2. Cat furniture vs office furninture. Good mapping between mental model and real world.
3. Should help understand things better
4. Simple problems easy to get good representations.

## Characteristics Of Good Representations

Here are some characteristics of good representations:

1. Depicts explicit relationships - Laying thing out helps easy understanding
2. Brings objects and relationships together - objects and relationships are explicit.
3. No extraneous information - Say only left to right, left out stupid information.
4. Expose natural constraints - brings envionment into pictures.

## Analogies And Metaphors

- If you can ground your interface in something users already know, you can get a solid foundation in teaching them how to use your interface. Ex - Walstreet website and paper are similar.
- However, when you use analogies to other interfaces, users may not know where the analogy ends. Therefore, we should pay special attention to misconceptions analogies introduce.
- Analogies make the interface more learnable, but they may restrict the interface to outdated constraints.

## Design Principles Revisited

How do mental models and representations tie into HCI design principles?

- Analogies and metaphors - principle of consistency is neeedd
- Interfaces should teach the user how the system works - principle of affordances
- Representations map the interface to the task at hand - principle of mapping

## Learning Curve
- Expertise vs Experience. Above line of proficiency.
- Rapid Learning curve with limited experience
- Difficult interface have slower learning curves
- conistency with analogies and representations


## User Error: Slips And Mistakes

- User mistakes/errors are common due to stress or lack of understanding of goal.

Two types of user error: (All by Norman)

- **Slips** - the user has the right mental model, but does the wrong thing anyway
  - **Action-based** - places where the user performs the wrong action, or performs the right action on the wrong object, even though they knew the correct action
  - **Memory lapse** - occurs when the user forgets something they knew to do
- **Mistakes** - the user has the wrong mental model, and does the wrong thing as a result
  - **Rule-based** - occurs when the user correctly assesses the state of the world but makes the wrong decision based on it
  - **Knowledge-based** - occur when the user incorrectly assesses the state of the world in the first place
  - **Memory lapse** - similar to memory lapse slips but focuses on forgetting to fully execute a plan

## Learned Helplessness

What happens when there is no useful feedback between the user's input and the interface's output?

- **Learned helplessness** - a user's sense that they are helpless to accomplish their goals in an interface. Window hang while reading large dataset.
	- Its related to educational technology.

## Expert Blind Spot

When you are an expert in something there are parts of the task that you do subconsciously without even thinking about them.
