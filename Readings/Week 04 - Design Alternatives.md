## Brainstorm, Chainstorm, Cheatstorm, Tweetstorm: New Ideation Strategies For Distributed HCI Design

> Faste, H., Rachmel, N., Essary, R., & Sheehan, E. (2013, April). Brainstorm, Chainstorm, Cheatstorm, Tweetstorm: new ideation strategies for distributed HCI design. In Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (pp. 1343-1352). ACM.

Topic: brainstorming is more than the pooling of “invented” ideas, it involves the sharing and interpretation of concepts in unintended and (ideally) unanticipated ways. Ideation, in short, is the radical redistribution of ideas to “unconventionalize” a given context.


- **Cheatstorming** - no new ideas are necessary for further ideation to occur


Goal of Paper - Specifically we focused our research on how digital tools might be used to enhance the practice of group ideation among members of asynchronously distributed collaborative teams

Mainfindng - that ideation need not be limited to the generation of new ideas. From this perspective, the value of
group ideation activities such as brainstorming has less to do with the creation of novel ideas than its cultural influence on
the ideating team.


### Osborns steps for brainstorming
(1) Fact-finding: Problem-definition and preparation; gathering and analyzing the relevant data.
(2) Idea-finding: Idea-production and idea-development; thinking of tentative ideas and possible leads and then
selecting and combining them.
(3) Solution finding: Evaluation and adoption; verifying the offered solutions, and deciding on and implementing a final
selected set.


### Idea Finding Phase

1. Criticism is ruled out: Adverse judgment of ideas must be withheld until later.
2. “Free-wheeling” is welcomed: the wilder the idea the better; it is easier to tame down than to think up.
3. Quantity is wanted: The greater the number of ideas, the more the likelihood of useful ideas.
4. Combination and improvement are sought: In addition to contributing ideas of their own, participants should suggest how ideas of others can be turned into better ideas; or how two or more ideas can be joined into still another idea


### Limitation of Brain storming

- **Production blocking:** Since only one person speaks at a time in a group setting, others are inhibited from expressing their ideas while another team-member is speaking, potentially slowing their ability to generate new ideas of their own. being in a situation where participants must passively listen to others’ ideas may distract and interrupt their thought processes and ability to record their own ideas
- **Evaluation apprehension** - Creativity by definition is an unconventional act, and being
creative therefore involves taking personal risks [13]. Even though one of the most important rules for successful
brainstorming is to “defer judgment,” the fear of being criticized for having original ideas is often pervasive. Productivity loss was observed in groups that had been informed of their presence relative to a control group that had not been told
- **Free riding** -It may be the case that a brainstorming participant’s motivation to work decreases if they do not perceive that they will be recognized for their participation


### Three forms of Ideation

- **Face-to-face Brainstorming Groups** The classic brainstorming session is done in face-to-face
groups during a fixed period of time, usually between 15 to 45 minutes [33, p. 178], and is facilitated by a trained
brainstorming expert that enforces the rules of brainstorming in the group. Participation is simultaneous and spontaneous:
all participants can see each other’s ideas and are encouraged to build upon them
- ** Nominal idea generation** It is done individually. The main element that defines this method is that participants are not
influenced by the variety of social factors at play in a traditional brainstorming group: they cannot build on other
participants’ ideas because they are not exposed to them, they will be less influenced by perceived criticisms to their ideas in real-time (although they may be reluctant to share them afterwards), they may be highly motivated to perform their
work in the anticipation that their efforts will eventually be rewarded, and so on
- **Computer Mediated Ideation** - Advances in digital technology have led to the potential for
a variety of computer-mediated ideation techniques. Within this category, the term “electronic brainstorming” refers to
any kind of brainstorming mediated by computers. One issue attempting to define electronic brainstorming is that any online activity that involves people entering information into cloud-based systems can be considered the contribution of “ideas” to a digital pool.

### Methodology and Design Research

- Our investigation began with the simple premise that collaborative ideation could be enhanced through the use of
distributed online tools, and design-driven approaches could be used to explore and investigate the potentialities of this
space.

Opportunity finding - Authors for seven areas of oppurtunity 
Electronic Brainstorming - Created how questions for oppuntunity with 50 ideas from 30+ participants and voted to get 35 ideas
Concept Selection - Arrangement into Impact/Achievability matrix and find out chain storming and cheat storming

### Model for group ideation:

1. Prompting
2. Sharing
3. Selecting
4. Committing


### Experiments

**Cheat Storming**
The basic premise of this paradigm is as follows: imagine a brainstorm has been performed, resulting in 50 ideas. Participants vote on their favorite ideas, and some of them are selected for implementation. Now another brainstorm is performed on a different topic, resulting in 50 more ideas and additional voting. In time, many hundreds of brainstorm questions are asked, and thousands of ideas are generated and saved. Some have been implemented, and others have not. At this point, a wealth of valuable brainstorming has already occurred. The cheatstorming paradigm proposes that no new ideas are necessary for further ideation to occur. Given a new prompt question and a set of 50 random previous ideas to draw from, cheatstorming simply bypasses the concept generation phase altogether and jumps directly to voting on which ideas to advance.

Experiment #1
- Create 5 questions and Random Solutions and Cheat storm to find correct and reliable solutions

Experiment #2 - how the variable effects of different types of “idea input”
would affect cheatstorming results. 
- Same question + different types of preconcienved ideas related unrelated and diverse with 4 criterias


### Findings

**Process of Cheatstorming**
- Cheatstorming was shown to be a fast and enjoyable means
of creative ideation
- Novel ideas due to related unrelated and diverse
- Indeed, the greatest challenge and thrill of the cheatstorming method is being faced with the
task of combining what often seem to be nonsensical results from previous brainstorming sessions
	- The natural reaction of the cheatstormer—indeed, their only real option—is to force an
inventive connection between ideation and prompt.
	- Study 2, with its larger set of inputs and greater creative freedom, introduced a more
overwhelming quantity of possible connections and, consequently, felt more tedious and less productive.

SUggestions
- Timer constraints
- Dont bias by color coding the idea types
-  In this regard, we believe that ideas that have been previously “used” by participants
should be removed from the input pool in successive rounds


**Results of Cheatstorming**
- Relative to the baseline brainstorm condition (condition A), the most noticeable quality of the winning cheatstormed
ideas was that all of them were dramatically technological in nature
	-  In condition A, the baseline condition, the ideas felt the most immediately useful and
applicable to the project because they did not all have such a technology focus
	- Condition B, the overlapping diverse input group, was the most palatable set of the remaining ideas. It
seemed to introduce fresh new ideas that were grounded in something familiar.
	- Condition C, the unrelated diverse input group, was described as “the most random.” Ideas in this
set—with names such as “tempo of experience control” and “real-time story-world generation”—were exciting but felt
out-of-touch with project goals.
	- Condition D, the unrelated diverse input group, were the most technologically immersive


### Stages of Ideation

(1) prompting, the stage during which the ideation facilitator
presents a challenge to the group that will drive ideation; 
(2) sharing, the stage in which participants suggest and
communicate ideas within the context of the medium that
frames the activity (i.e., orally, and/or using a whiteboard,
sticky-notes, database system, and so on); 
(3) selecting, the phase during which participants vote and/or otherwise
determine their favorite ideas; and
(4) committing, the stage at which a final criterion is set to evaluate and prioritize
ideas, ultimately determining which ones the team moves
forward with and (ideally) develop.


## Chapter 6: The Process Of Interaction Design

> Rogers, Y., Sharp, H., & Preece, J. (2011). Chapter 6: The Process of Interaction Design. In Interaction Design: Beyond Human-Computer Interaction. John Wiley & Sons.

Topic: how to design and build interactive products.

Main points:

1. Consider what _doing_ design involves
2. Ask and provide answers for important questions about the interaction design process
3. Introduce the idea of a life cycle model to represent a set of activities and how they are related
4. Describe some life cycle models from software engineering and HCI and discuss how they relate to the process of interaction design
5. Present a life cycle model of interaction design

### What Is Interaction Design About

- The definition of design from the Oxford English Dictionary captures the essence of design very well: "(design is) a plan or scheme conceived in the mind and intended for subsequent execution."
- In interaction design, we investigate the artifact's use and target domain by taking a user-centered ap'proach to development
- Although possible, it is unlikely that just one person will be involved in developing and using a system and therefore the plan must be communicated. This requires it to be captured and expressed in some suitable form that allows review, revision, and improvement. There are many ways of doing this, one of the simplest being to produce a series of sketches. Other common approaches are to write a description in natural language, to draw a series of diagrams, and to build prototypes
- Interaction design involves developing a plan which is informed by the product's intended use, target domain, and relevant practical considerations.

### Four Basic Activities Of Interaction Design

Below are four basic activities of interaction design:

1. Identifying needs and establishing requirements
2. Developing alternative designs that meet those requirements
	-  This activity can be broken up into two sub-activities: conceptual design and physical design. 
	-  Conceptual design involves producing the conceptual model for the product, and a conceptual model describes what the product should do, behave and look like
3. Building interactive versions so that they can be communicated and assessed
	- The most sensible way for users to evaluate such designs, then, is to interact with them. This requires an interactive version of the designs to be built, but that does not mean that a software version is required. 
	- Paper based prototypes
4. Evaluating them
	- Evaluation is the process of determining the usability and acceptability of the product or design that is measured in terms of a variety of criteria including the number of errors users make using it, how appealing it is, how well it matches the requirements, and so on. 

### Key Characteristics Of The Interaction Design Process

1. Focus on users - encourage focus on such issues and provide opportunities for evaluation and user feedback
2. Specific usability and user experience goals - should be identified, clearly documented, and agreed upon at the beginning of the project.
3. Iteration -  allows designs to be refined based on feedback

### Pratical Issues
1. Who are the users? - Primary users are those likely to be frequent hands-on users of the system; secondary users are occasional users or those who use the system through an intermediary; and tertiary users are those affected by the introduction of the system or who will influence its purchase. Stakeholders are "people or organizations who will be affected by the system and who have a direct or indirect influence on the system requirements
2. What do we mean by needs? 
	- Instead, we have to approach it by understanding the characteristics and capabilities of the users, what they are trying to achieve, how they achieve it currently, and whether they would achieve their goals more effectively if they were supported differently
	- If a product is a new invention, then it can be difficult to identify the users and representative tasks for them
3.  How do you generate alternative designs? 
	- Normally, innovations arise through cross-fertilization of ideas from different applications, the evolution of an existing product through use and observation, or straightforward copying of other, similar products
	- That browsing a collection of designs will inspire designers to consider alternative perspectives, and hence alternative solutions.
	- Alternatives come from looking at other, similar designs, and the process of inspiration and creativity can be enhanced by prompting a designer's own experience and by looking at others' ideas and solutions
4.  How do you choose among alternative designs?
	- Those that are about externally visible and measurable features, and those that are about characteristics internal to the system that cannot be observed or measured without dissecting it.
	- So, one answer to the question posed above is that we choose between alternative designs by letting users and stakeholders interact with them and by discussing their experiences, preferences and suggestions for improvement 
	- Another basis on which to choose between alternatives is "quality," but this requires a clear understanding of what "quality" means. People's views of what is a quality product vary, and we don't always write it down.
	- The process of writing down formal, verifiable-and hence measurable-usability criteria is a key characteristic of an approach to interaction design called usability engineering that has emerged over many years and with various proponents.

### Life Cycle Models: Showing How The Activities Are Related

The term _life cycle model_ is used to represent a model that captures a set of activities and how they are related.

#### A simple lifecycle model for interaction design
- It is based on our observations of interaction design and on information we have gleaned in the research for this book.
- Commonly used approach - see figure

Water Fall model and Spiral model for software design
- Two features of the spiral model are immediately clear from risk analysis and prototyping. The spiral model incorporates them in an iterative framework that allows ideas and progress to be repeatedly checked and evaluated. Each iteration around the spiral may be based on a different lifecycle
model and may have different activities. 

Rapid Application Development
- Time Boxing
- Joint Application Development

#### HCI Lifecycle Models
- Star Lifecycle Model
	- Flexibile and do anything kind of approach
- Usability Engineering Lifecycle Model
	-  However, what her lifecycle does provide is a holistic view of usability engineering and a detailed description of how to perform usability tasks, and it specifies how usability tasks can be integrated into traditional software development lifecycles.

## Observations On Concept Generation And Sketching In Engineering Design

> Yang, M. C. (2009). Observations on concept generation and sketching in engineering design. Research in Engineering Design, 20(1), 1-11.

Topic: concept generation examined via brainstorming, morphology charts and sketching. Correlations were found between the quantity of morphological alternatives and design outcome. The volume of dimensioned drawings generated during the early-to-middle phases of design were found to correlate with design outcome, suggesting the importance of concrete sketching, timing and milestones in the design process.

Exploring three hypotheses:

1. The quantity of concepts generated at the beginning of a design project correlates with design outcome
2. The quantity of sketches generated during a project correlates with its design outcome
3. Increased sketching at the beginning of the project, rather than at the end, correlates with better design outcome

Method: taking sample data from various courses (three courses with data taken from multiple years as well) and comparing concept generation techniques versus results of the course project for each of the courses. Morphology charts were created in all three courses. Paper-based design logbooks were kept by each student over the life of the project.

Results: A total of 4,008 sketches were counted in the logbooks. 61.4% included dimensions and the remaining 38.6% did not.

1. Results vs hypothesis 1: hypothesis holds true for shorter duration projects but not for longer duration projects
2. Results vs hypothesis 2: no statistically significant correlations were found between the total quantity of either dimensioned or total sketches of any type and final grade or contest ranking for the three courses
3. Results vs hypothesis 3: the proposed hypothesis is shown to be true. In addition, the role of milestones in planning design work may be important, and falling behind in design is linked to poorer outcomes

Conclusion: Concept generation measured in the form of morphology charts showed a statistically significant correlation with both project and final term grade in the introductory course. However, morphology charts in the advanced courses did not show a statistically significant correlation.
