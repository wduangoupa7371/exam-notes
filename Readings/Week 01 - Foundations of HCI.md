From the perspective of the test, your emphasis in reading these papers should be in getting a sufficient understanding of the material to answer high-level questions about the paper, as well as to be able to find answers quickly for more specific questions.

## Historical Context - MacKenzie

> MacKenzie, I.S. (2013). Chapter 1: Historical Context. Human-Computer Interaction: An Empirical Research Perspective. (pp. 1-26). Waltham, MA: Elsevier.

- Human factors is both a science and a field of engineering. It is concerned with
human capabilities, limitations, and performance, and with the design of systems
that are efficient, safe, comfortable, and even enjoyable for the humans who use
them.
- HCI, then, is human factors, but narrowly focused on human interaction with
computing technology of some sort. That said, HCI itself does not feel “narrowly focused.” On the contrary, HCI is tremendously broad in scope. It draws upon interests and expertise in disciplines such as
psychology (particularly cognitive psychology and experimental psychology), sociology, anthropology, cognitive science, computer science, and linguistics.
- **User study** - in this book refers to an experiment with human participants
- HCI emerged in the 1980s, the discipline most central to HCI is _human factors_ or _ergonomics_


### Notable Events

- **Vannevar Bush** - had ideas about storing and accessing information like what we are currently able to do with the internet. Bush proposed navigating the knowledge maze with a device he called memex. Among the features of memex is associative indexing, whereby points of interest can be connected and joined so that selecting one item immediately and automatically selects another.
- **Sketchpad** - Proposed by Ivan sutherlandthe first _direct manipulation_ interface. The use of a pointing device for input makes Sketchpad the first direct manipulation interface—a sign of things to come
- **Douglas Engelbart** - invented the mouse in 1963. Won turing award in 1997 and SIGCHI Lifetime achievement award.
- **Xerox Star** - novel feature of the _desktop metaphor_. Metaphors are important in HCI. When a metaphor is present, the user has a jump-start on knowing what to do. The user exploits existing knowledge from another domain. The desktop
metaphor brings concepts from the office desktop to the system’s display.
- **SIGCHI** - Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction (1982)
- **The Psychology of Human-Computer Interaction** - written by Card, Moran, and Newell; connects low-level human processes with interactions humans have with computers. The framework for this was the model human processor (MHP).
	- Newell astutely identifies a dilemma in the field: experimentation cannot be done until it is too late. As he put
it, the system is built and the degrees of freedom are bound. This is an overstatement, perhaps, but it is true that novel interactions in new products always seem to be followed by a flurry of research papers identifying weaknesses and suggesting and evaluating improvements.
	- This is very important part of the chapter and must read.
	- **MHP** - _model human processor_	
	- **KLM** - _keystroke-level model_

## The Psychopathology Of Everyday Things - Don Norman

> Norman, D. (2013). Chapter 1: The Psychopathology of Everyday Things. In The Design of Everyday Things: Revised and Expanded Edition. (pp. 1-36). Arizona: Basic Books.

### Topic: psychopathology of everyday things.

### Discoverability and Understanding
- Discoverability: Is it possible to even figure out what actions are possible and where and how to perform them? 
- Understanding: What does it all mean? How is the product supposed to be used? What do all the different controls and settings mean?
	- The doors in the story illustrate what happens when discoverability fails.
	- With complex devices, discoverability and understanding require the aid of manuals or personal instruction. We accept this if the device is indeed complex, but it should be unnecessary for simple things. 

### Types of Designs

The major areas of design relevant to this book are industrial design, interaction design, and experience design. None of the fields is well defined, but the focus of the efforts does vary, with industrialone designers emphasizing form and material, interactive designers emphasizing understandability and usability, and experience designers emphasizing the emotional impact


- **Industrial design** - the professional service of creating and developing concepts and specifications that optimize the function, value, and appearance of products and systems for the mutual benefit of both user and manufacturer
- **Interaction design** - the focus is upon how people interact with technology. The goal is to enhance people’s understanding of what can be done, what is happening, and what has just occurred. Interaction design draws upon principles of psychology, design, art, and emotion to ensure a positive, enjoyable experience
- **Experience design** - the practice of designing products, processes, services, events, and environments with a focus placed on the quality and enjoyment of the total experience
- Design is concerned with how things work, how they are controlled, and the nature of the interaction between people and technology


### Errors in Design - 3 Mile Island

- My work with that committee (American nuclear power) of changed my view of design. Today, I realize that design presents a fascinating interplay of technology and psychology, that the designers must understand both. 
- The operators were blamed for these failures: “human error” was the immediate analysis. But the committee I was on discovered that the plant’s control rooms were so poorly designed that error was inevitable: design was at fault, not the operators. The moral was simple: we were designing things for people, so we needed to understand both technology and people. But that’s a difficult step for many engineers: machines are so logical, so orderly. If we didn’t have people, everything would work so much better. Yup, that’s how I used to think

### Error v/s Engineers

Engineers still tend to believe in logic. They often explain to me in great, logical detail, why their designs are good, powerful, and wonderful. 
- “Why are people having problems?” they wonder. “You are being too logical,” I say. “You are designing for people the
way you would like them to be, not for the way they really are.”
- When the engineers object, I ask whether they have ever made an error, perhaps turning on or off the wrong light, or the wrong8 The Design of Everyday Things stove burner. “Oh yes,” they say, “but those were errors.” That’s
the point: even experts make errors. So we must design our machines on the assumption that people will make errors
- 

### Human Centered Design
- It is an an approach that puts human needs, capabilities, and behavior first, then designs to accommodate those needs, capabilities, and ways of behaving. Good design starts with an understanding of psychology and technology. 
- Good design requires good communication, especially from machine to person, indicating what actions are possible,
what is happening, and what is about to happen. Communication is especially important when things go wrong. It is relatively easy to design things that work smoothly and harmoniously long as things go right. 
- But as soon as there is a problem or a misunderstanding, the problems arise. This is where good design
is essential. Designers need to focus their attention on the cases where things go wrong, not just on when things work as planned.
- Actually, this is where the most satisfaction can arise: when something goes wrong but the machine highlights the problems, then the person understands the issue, takes the proper actions, and the problem is solved. When this happens smoothly, the collaboration of person and device feels wonderful.
- Human-centered design is a design philosophy. It means starting with a good understanding of people and the needs that the design is intended to meet.

### Priciples of Interaction
- Experience is critical, for it determines how fondly people remember their interactions. Was the overall experience positive, or was it frustrating and confusing? When our home technology behaves in an uninterpretable fashion we can become confused, frustrated, and even angry—all strong negative emotions.
- Discoverability results from five fundamental psychological concepts: _affordances_, _signifiers_, _constraints_, _mappings_, and _feedback_; there is also another more important principle called _conceptual model_ of the system
- **Affordances** - The term affordance refers to the relationship between a physical object and a person (or for that matter, any interacting agent, whether animal or human, or even machines and robots). An affordance is a relationship between the properties of an object and the capabilities of the agent that determine just how the object could
possibly be used. A chair affords (“is for”) support and, therefore, affords sitting. Most chairs can also be carried by a single person (they afford lifting), but some can only be lifted by a strong person or by a team of people. If young or relatively weak people cannot lift a chair, then for these people, the chair does not have
that affordance, it does not afford lifting
	- **Percieved affordances** - often act as signifiers, but they can be ambiguous. See case study.
- **Signifiers** - signal things, in particular what actions are possible and how they should be done; signifiers must be perceivable, else they fail to function. Signifiers communicate where the action should take place.
We need both.
- **Mapping** - Mapping is an important concept in the design and layout of controls and displays. When the mapping uses spatial correspondence between the layout of the controls and the devices being controlled, it is easy to determine how to use them. In steering a car, we rotate the steering wheel clockwise to cause the car to turn right: the top of the wheel moves in the same direction as the car
	- Natural mapping, by which I mean taking advantage of spatial analogies, leads to immediate understanding. For example, to move an object up, move the control up. To make it easy to determine which control works which light in a large room or auditorium, arrange the controls in the same pattern as the lights.
- **Feedback** - Feedback—communicating the results of an action—is a wellknown concept from the science of control and information theory.
	- Feedback must be immediate: even a delay of a tenth of a second can be disconcerting. If the delay is too long, people often give up, going off to do other activities.
	- Too much feedback can be even more annoying than too little. My dishwasher likes to beep at three a.m. to tell me that the wash is done, defeating my goal of having it work in the middle of the night so as not to disturb anyone (and to use less expensive electricity)
	- Poor design of feedback can be the result of decisions aimed at reducing costs, even if they make life more difficult for people. Rather than use multiple signal lights, informative displays, or rich, musical sounds with varying patterns, the focus upon cost reduction forces the design to use a single light or sound to convey multiple types of information
	- Feedback has to be planned. All actions need to be confirmed, but in a manner that is unobtrusive. Feedback must also be prioritized, so that unimportant information is presented in an unobtrusive fashion, but important signals are presented in a way that does capture attention

### Conceptual Models
- A conceptual model is an explanation, usually highly simplified, of how something works. It doesn’t have to be complete or even accurate as long as it is useful. The files, folders, and icons you see displayed on a computer screen help people create the conceptual model of documents and folders inside the computer, or of apps or applications residing on the screen, waiting to be summoned
- There are often multiple conceptual models of a product or device. People’s conceptual models for the way that regenerative braking in a hybrid or electrically powered automobile works are quite different for average drivers than for technically sophisticated drivers, different again for whoever must service the system, and yet different again for those who designed the system.
- The major clues to how things work come from their perceived structure—in particular from signifiers, affordances, constraints, and mappings
- What happens when the device does not suggest a good conceptual model? Consider my digital watch with five buttons: two along the top, two along the bottom, and one on the left side (Figure 1.8). What is each button for? How would you set the time? There is no way to tell—no evident relationship between the operating controls and the functions, no constraints, no apparent mappings.

### System Image
- People create mental models of themselves, others, the environment, and the things with which they interact. These are conceptual models formed through experience, training, and instruction. These models serve as guides to help achieve our goals and in understanding the world
- what the device looks like, what we know from using similar things in the past, what was told to us in the sales literature, by salespeople and advertisements, by articles we may have read, by the product website and instruction manuals. I call the combined information available to us the system image. 



## Cognitive Engineering (Don Norman)

Cognitive Engineering 
	- Applied Cognitive Science, trying to apply what is known from science to design and construction to machines
	- Goal is to understand issues, how to make better choices when there are many, show tradeoffs when improvement in one domain leads to deficits in another

End Intention
	- To understand the fundamental principles behind human action and performance that are relevant for the development of engineering principles of design.
	- To devise systems that are pleasant to use-the goal is neither efficiency nor ease nor power, although these are all to be desired, but rather systems that are pleasant, even fun: to pro- duce what Laurel calls "pleasurable engagement" (Chapter 4).

### Analysis of Task Complexity
Sailors and Compass Example
	- The correct conceptual model can transform confus- ing, difficult tasks into simple, straightforward ones. This is an important point that forms the theme of a later section.

### Psychological Variables Differ From Physical Variables
There is a discrepancy between the person's psychologically expressed goals and the physical controls and variables of the task.
	- the person must interpret the physical variables into terms relevant to the psycho- logical goals and must translate the psychological intentions into physi- cal actions upon the mechanisms

***Examples of Problems and relationships between variables (Very Important)*** 
- Bathtub
1. Mapping problems. Which control is hot, which is cold? Which way should each control be turned to increase or decrease the flow? (Despite the appearance of universal standards for these mappings, there are sufficient variations in the standards, idiosyncratic layouts, and violations of expectations, that each new faucet poses potential problems.) 
2. Ease of control. To make the water hotter while maintaining total rate constant requires simultaneous manipulation of both faucets. 
3. Evaluation. With two spouts, it is sometimes difficult to deter- mine if the correct outcome has been reached.

- Normans Refrigirator
1. Matching the psychological variables of interest to the physical variables being controlled. Although the labels on the control mechanisms indicate some relationship to the desired psycho- logical variables, in fact, they do not control those variables directly.
2. The mapping relationships. There is clearly strong interaction between the two controls, making simple mapping between control and function or control and outcome difficult.
3. Feedback. Very slow, so that by the time one is able to deter- mine the result of an action, so much time has passed that the action is no longer remembered, making "correction" of the action difficult.
4. Conceptual model. None. The instructions seem deliberately opaque and nondescriptive of the actual operations.


### Aspects of a Task (Very Important)

- **Goals and intentions** : A goal is the state the person wishes to achieve an in- tention is the decision to act so as to achieve the goal.
- **Specification of the action sequence**: The psychological process of determining the psycho- logical representation of the actions that are to be executed by the user on the mechanisms of the system.
- **Mapping from psychological goals and intentions to action sequence**: In order to specify the action sequence, the user must translate the psychological goals and intentions into the desired system state, then determine what settings of the control mechanisms will yield that state, and then determine what physical manipulations of the mechan- isms are required. The result is the internal, mental specification of the actions that are to be executed.
- **Physical state of the system**: The physical state of the system, determined by the values of all its physical variables.
- **Control mechanisms**: The physical devices that control the physical variables.
- **Mapping between the physical mechanisms and system state**: The relationship between the settings of the mechan- isms of the system and the system state.
- **Interpretation of system state**: The relationship between the physical state of the sys- tem and the psychological goals of the user can only be determined by first translating the physical state into psychological states (perception), then interpreting the perceived system state in terms of the psychological variables of interest.
- **Evaluating the outcome**: Evaluation of the system state requires comparing the interpretation of the perceived system state with the desired goals. This often leads to a new set of goals and intentions.


### Theory of Action (Approximate version)

- **Gulf of Execution**
	- Bridging the Gulf of Execution. The gap from goals to physical sys- tem is bridged in four segments: intention formation, specifying the action sequence, executing the action, and, finally, making contact with the input mechanisms of the interface. 
		- The intention is the first step, and it starts to bridge the gulf, in part because the interaction language demanded by the physical system comes to color the thoughts of the person.
		- Specifying the action requires translating the psychological goals of the intention into the changes to be made to the physical variables actually under control of the system. 
			-This, in turn, requires following the mapping between the psychological intentions and the physical actions permitted on the mechanisms of the system, as well as the mapping between the physical mechanisms and the resulting physical state variables, and between the physical state of the system and the psychological goals and intentions
		- After an appropriate action sequence is determined, the actions must be executed. Execution is the first physical action in this sequence: Forming the goals and intentions and specifying the action sequence were all mental events. 
		- Because some physical actions are more difficult than others, the choice of input devices can affect the selection of actions, which in turn affects how well the system matches with intentions

- **Gulf of Evaluation**
	- The gap from sys- tem to user is bridged in four segments: 
		- starting with the output displays of the interface, 
		- moving to the perceptual processing of those displays, 
		- to its interpretation, and 
		- finally, to the evaluation - the comparison of the interpretation of system state with the original goals and intention. 
	- But in doing all this, there is one more problem, one just beginning to be understood, and one not assisted by the usual forms of displays: the problem of level. There may be many levels of outcomes that must be matched with different levels of intentions

### Stages in User Activities

Summary of the analysis of tasks is that the process of performing and evaluating an action can be approximated by seven stages of user activity
	- Establishing the Goal
	- Forming the Intention
	- Specifying the Action Sequence
	- Executing the Action
	- Perceiving the System State 
	- Interpreting the State 
	- Evaluating the System State with respect to the Goals and Intentions

*Note - Read page 43 complex activity*

### Conceptual Models and System Image

*Note - This section is bit ambigous*

-  We change the interface at the system side through proper design. We change the interface at the human side through training and experience. 
- In the ideal case, no psychological effort is required to bridge the gulfs. But such a situation occurs only either with simple situations or with experienced, expert users. 
- With complex tasks or with nonexpert users, the user must engage in a plan- ning process to go from intentions to action sequence. 

- Conceptual model of the system as providing a scaffold- ing upon which to build the bridges across the gulfs. The scaffoldings provided by these conceptual models are probably only important dur- ing learning and trouble-shooting.

	- Design(er) Model
		- The Design Model is the conceptual model of the system to be built. Ideally, this conceptualization is based on the user's task, requirements, and capabilities. The conceptualization must also consider the user's background, experience, and the powers and limitations of the user's information processing mechanisms, most especially processing resources and short-term memory limits. 
	- User model
		- The user develops a mental model of the system-the User's Model. Note that the user model is not formed from the Design Model: It results from the way the user interprets the System Image. 
		- Thus, in many ways, the primary task of the designer is to construct an appropri- ate System Image, realizing that everything the user interacts with helps to form that image
			- Examples - the physical knobs, dials, keyboards, and displays, and the documentation, including instruction manuals, help facilities, text input and output, and error messages.


### ON Quality of HCI
- The details of the interaction matter, ease of use matters, but I want more than correct details, more than a system that is easy to learn or to use: I want a system that is enjoyable to use. This is an important, dominating design philosophy, easier to say than to do.
	- This means tools that reveal their under- lying conceptual model and allow for interaction, tools that emphasize comfort, ease, and pleasure of use
	- A major factor in this debate is the feeling of control that the user has over the operations that are being performed. 
	- A "powerful," "intelligent" system can lead to the well documented problems of "overautomation," causing the user to be a passive observer of operations, no longer in control of either what operations take place, or of how they are done. 
- Overall the critical aspect is "pleasurable engagement," by which it means the complete and full engagement of the person in pursuit of the "end cause" of the activity.

**Example of Issue in Tool** - Pinball set : Much as I enjoy manipulating the parts of the pinball sets, much as my 4-year-old son could learn to work it with almost no training or bother, neither of us are any good at constructing pinball sets. I can't quite get the parts in the right places:
	- When I stretch a part to change its shape, I usually end up with an unworkable part. Balls get stuck in weird corners. The action is either too fast or too slow. Yes, it is easy to change each problem as it is discovered, but the number seems endless. I wish the tools were more intelligent

### Revisiting the GULFs

Theory suggests that two of the mappings play critical roles: 
	- the mapping from the psychological variables in which the goals are stated to the physical variables upon which the control is actually exerted
	- the mapping from the physical variables of the system to psychological variables. The easier and more direct these two mappings, the easier and more pleasant the learning and use of the interface, at least so goes the theory

### Design Issues
- Any real system is the result of a series of tradeoffs that balance one design decision against another, that take into account time, effort, and expense. Almost always the benefits of a design decision along one dimension lead to deficits along some other dimension. 
- The designer must consider the wide class of users, the physical limitations, the con- straints caused by time and economics, and the limitations of the tech- nology. Moreover, the science and engineering disciplines necessary for a proper design of the interface do not yet exist. 
	- Approximate Models in Design
		* Although the approximate model is clearly wrong in all its details, in most practical applications the details of STM do not matter: This approximate model can be very valuable. Other approximate models are easy to find. 
	- Tradeoffs
		* Design is a series of tradeoffs: Assistance for one stage is apt to inter- fere with another. Any single design technique is apt to have its vir- tues along one dimension compensated by deficiencies along another. Each technique provides a set of tradeoffs
		* **The prototypical tradeoff: information versus time**.
			- Factors that increase informative- ness tend to decrease the amount of available workspace and system respon- siveness. On the one hand, the more informative and complete the display, the more useful when the user has doubts or lacks understand- ing. On the other hand, the more complete the display, the longer it takes to be displayed and the more space it must occupy physically.
		* **First- and second-order issues**
			- One major tradeoff concerns just which aspects of the system will be worked on. With limited time and people, the design team has to make decisions: Some parts of the sys- tem will receive careful attention, others will not. Each different aspect of the design takes time, energy, and resources, none of which is apt to be readily available. Therefore, it is important to be able to distinguish the first order effects from the secondary effects-the big issues from the little issues.


### Prescriptions for Design Principles
- **Create a science of user-centered design** 
	- For this, we need prin- ciples that can be applied at the time of the design, principles that get the design to a pretty good state the first time around.
- **Take interface design seriously as an independent and important problem** 
	- It takes at least three kinds of special knowledge to design an interface: first, knowledge of design, of program- ming and of the technology, second, knowledge of people, of the principles of mental computation, of communication, and of interaction and third, expert knowledge of the task that is to be accomplished.
	-  We need either especially trained interface special- ists or teams of designers, some members expert in the topic domain of the device, some expert in the mechanics of the device, and some expert about people. 
- **Separate the design of the interface from the design of the system**
	- This is the principle of modularization in design. It allows the previous point to work. Today, in most systems, everyone has access to control of the screen or mouse
- **Do user-centered system design: Start with the needs of the user** 
	- From the point of view of the user, the interface is the system. Concern for the nature of the interaction and for the user- these are the things that should force the design. 
	- Let the requirements for the interaction drive the design of the inter- face, let ideas about the interface drive the technology.
